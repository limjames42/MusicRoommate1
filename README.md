CS 207 Project(Unfinished

In order to run my code, since it is not fully complete, you must install Android studio and install one of the emulator phones that they have already implemented for you. If you do not have the time for this, I have attached a short 2 minute video of the functionality of my app, including the sign up, sign in, sign out, and edit profile features. I will continue to add features to my app in the upcoming days so when I finish, I can send you the link for when I upload it to the google play store.
For the majority of my app, I do not have many comments. Even though it is a lot of implementation, it is fairly straightforward. 
Whenever I want to click on a button, there is a (setOnClickListener) that when clicking that button, changes the location of the app for that current user. I have many xml files for different colors, backgrounds, gradients, and strings. All of the UI is held under the Res->Layout dropdown in the Android portion of the project. [ Android portion is displayed in the top left drop down menu] It may say Project and have a TV on it initially, but the files are all under the Android menu item.

If you do choose to download the run the code on Android, simply build the app and run it.
I have used some outside libraries however, such as Picasso (an image library for Android), but since I have not gotten to that point yet, in the implementation, I am sure you can just comment out its implementation in the app {build.gradle (app)} file. That would be under the Gradle scripts portion of the drop down menu. 
You may also need to connect the app to firebase on your computer, but I am not sure how that works, if you have any difficulties with running the app, please feel free to email me and I will answer as soon as possible. Thank you.

Thank you the fantastic semester Professor Hamid, and I hope you stay safe and are happy at your next institution. It was great having you as a Professor, have a nice summer.
